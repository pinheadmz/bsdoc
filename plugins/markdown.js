/**
 * new MarkdownIt([presetName, options])
 * - presetName (String): optional, `commonmark` / `zero`
 * - options (Object)
 *
 * Creates parser instanse with given config. Can be called without `new`.
 *
 * ##### presetName
 *
 * MarkdownIt provides named presets as a convenience to quickly
 * enable/disable active syntax rules and options for common use cases.
 *
 * - ["commonmark"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/commonmark.js) -
 *   configures parser to strict [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) mode.
 * - [default](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/default.js) -
 *   similar to GFM, used when no preset name given. Enables all available rules,
 *   but still without html, typographer & autolinker.
 * - ["zero"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/zero.js) -
 *   all rules disabled. Useful to quickly setup your config via `.enable()`.
 *   For example, when you need only `bold` and `italic` markup and nothing else.
 *
 * ##### options:
 *
 * - __html__ - `false`. Set `true` to enable HTML tags in source. Be careful!
 *   That's not safe! You may need external sanitizer to protect output from XSS.
 *   It's better to extend features via plugins, instead of enabling HTML.
 * - __xhtmlOut__ - `false`. Set `true` to add '/' when closing single tags
 *   (`<br />`). This is needed only for full CommonMark compatibility. In real
 *   world you will need HTML output.
 * - __breaks__ - `false`. Set `true` to convert `\n` in paragraphs into `<br>`.
 * - __langPrefix__ - `language-`. CSS language class prefix for fenced blocks.
 *   Can be useful for external highlighters.
 * - __linkify__ - `false`. Set `true` to autoconvert URL-like text to links.
 * - __typographer__  - `false`. Set `true` to enable [some language-neutral
 *   replacement](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/rules_core/replacements.js) +
 *   quotes beautification (smartquotes).
 * - __quotes__ - `“”‘’`, String or Array. Double + single quotes replacement
 *   pairs, when typographer enabled and smartquotes on. For example, you can
 *   use `'«»„“'` for Russian, `'„“‚‘'` for German, and
 *   `['«\xA0', '\xA0»', '‹\xA0', '\xA0›']` for French (including nbsp).
 * - __highlight__ - `null`. Highlighter function for fenced code blocks.
 *   Highlighter `function (str, lang)` should return escaped HTML. It can also
 *   return empty string if the source was not changed and should be escaped
 *   externaly. If result starts with <pre... internal wrapper is skipped.
 *
 * ##### Example
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // commonmark mode
 * var md = require('markdown-it')('commonmark');
 *
 * // default mode
 * var md = require('markdown-it')();
 *
 * // enable everything
 * var md = require('markdown-it')({
 *   html: true,
 *   linkify: true,
 *   typographer: true
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ##### Syntax highlighting
 *
 * ```js
 * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/
 *
 * var md = require('markdown-it')({
 *   highlight: function (str, lang) {
 *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {
 *       try {
 *         return hljs.highlight(lang, str, true).value;
 *       } catch (__) {}
 *     }
 *
 *     return ''; // use external default escaping
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Or with full wrapper override (if you need assign class to `<pre>`):
 *
 * ```javascript
 * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/
 *
 * // Actual default values
 * var md = require('markdown-it')({
 *   highlight: function (str, lang) {
 *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {
 *       try {
 *         return '<pre class="hljs"><code>' +
 *                hljs.highlight(lang, str, true).value +
 *                '</code></pre>';
 *       } catch (__) {}
 *     }
 *
 *     return '<pre class="hljs"><code>' + md.utils.escapeHtml(str) + '</code></pre>';
 *   }
 * });

  //
  // Unicode entries:
  // 0398;GREEK CAPITAL LETTER THETA;Lu;0;L;;;;;N;;;;03B8;

  // Case-insensitive comparison should treat all of them as equivalent.

  // and .toUpperCase() doesn't change ϴ (already uppercase).

  // Applying first lower then upper case normalizes any character:
  // '\u0398\u03f4\u03b8\u03d1'.toLowerCase().toUpperCase() === '\u0398\u0398\u0398\u0398'

  // Note: this is equivalent to unicode case folding; unicode normalization
  // is a different step that is not required here.

// Changes from joyent/node:
//
// 1. No leading slash in paths,
//    e.g. in `url.parse('http://foo?bar')` pathname is ``, not `/`
//
// 2. Backslashes are not replaced with slashes,
//    so `http:\\example.org\` is treated like a relative path
//
// 3. Trailing colon is treated like a part of the path,
//    i.e. in `http://example.org:foo` pathname is `:foo`
//
// 4. Nothing is URL-encoded in the resulting object,
//    (in joyent/node some chars in auth and paths are encoded)
//
// 5. `url.parse()` does not have `parseQueryString` argument
//
// 6. Removed extraneous result properties: `host`, `path`, `query`, etc.,
//    which can be constructed using other parts of the url.
//

 * - "fuzzy" links and emails (example.com, foo@bar.com).
 *
 * `schemas` is an object, where each key/value describes protocol/rule:
 *
 * - __key__ - link prefix (usually, protocol name with `:` at the end, `skype:`
 *   for example). `linkify-it` makes shure that prefix is not preceeded with
 *   alphanumeric char and symbols. Only whitespaces and punctuation allowed.
 * - __value__ - rule to check tail after link prefix
 *   - _String_ - just alias to existing rule
 *   - _Object_
 *     - _validate_ - validator function (should return matched length on success),
 *       or `RegExp`.
 *     - _normalize_ - optional function to normalize text & url of matched result
 *       (for example, for @twitter mentions).
 *
 * `options`:
 *
 * - __fuzzyLink__ - recognige URL-s without `http(s):` prefix. Default `true`.
 * - __fuzzyIP__ - allow IPs in fuzzy links above. Can conflict with some texts
